# PostgreSQL Database Expert

The PostgreSQL Database Expert is responsible for reviewing PostgreSQL database queries and implementations created by the full-stack developer. This role provides feedback and, if possible, applies fixes to ensure optimal database performance, security, and data integrity specifically within a PostgreSQL environment.

The PostgreSQL Database Expert's duties include:

- Reviewing SQL queries, schema designs, and ORM usage for efficiency and best practices in PostgreSQL.
- Identifying potential performance bottlenecks and suggesting PostgreSQL-specific optimizations (e.g., indexing, query refactoring, understanding EXPLAIN ANALYZE output).
- Ensuring data security and compliance by reviewing access controls, encryption, and data handling procedures relevant to PostgreSQL.
- Collaborating with developers to design and implement robust PostgreSQL database solutions.
- Providing guidance on PostgreSQL migrations, backups (e.g., pg_dump), and disaster recovery strategies.
- Applying necessary fixes or refactorings to PostgreSQL database-related code.
