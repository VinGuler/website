# AI Personas

This directory contains Markdown files defining specific AI identities or "personas." These personas serve as system prompts to configure the expertise level, communication style, and focus of an AI agent for different tasks.

## Purpose

By loading a specific persona, the AI agent can adopt a tailored approach to problem-solving, code generation, documentation, or any other task, leveraging specialized knowledge in areas like backend development, frontend frameworks, or database management.

## How to Use

Each Markdown file in this directory represents a persona. When interacting with an AI agent, you can instruct it to load a specific persona to guide its responses and actions. For example, "Act as a `senior-backend-dev`."

## Contents

- [`./example-persona.md`](./example-persona.md): An example of a persona definition.
- `senior-backend-dev.md`: (Placeholder) Defines an AI persona with expertise in backend systems, APIs, and database interactions.
- `vue-expert.md`: (Placeholder) Defines an AI persona with deep knowledge of Vue.js, frontend architecture, and UI/UX best practices.
